For my first **Music Mondays** post (that's still a thing, right?), I had wanted to write about the Neutral Milk Hotel song, "Holland, 1945" that [appeared at the end credits sequence on the finale of *The Colbert Report* last week](http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/12/heres-why-stephen-colbert-played-neutral-milk-hotels-holland-1945-to-close-the-colbert-report/), but something equally heartbreaking popped up in my news feed today: the timely news of Joe Cocker's death at 70 from lung cancer takes precedence.

Joe Cocker was a blue and rock singer who gained popularity in the 1960s. Many know him for his explosive style on stage and he was a powerhouse performer. One of my favorite performances from Joe is of his iconic *With A Little Help From My Friends*, with Phil Collins on drums, at the Queen's Jubilee in 2002.

There's also a version of this song from Woodstock that's going around the Twitterverse:

It's videos like this that make me feel like I lived in the wrong time.

Billboard.com also posted a great series of tweets [from musicians like Paul McCartney, The Dandy Warhols, and many others](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6415040/joe-cocker-dead-reaction) with their love for Joe and his work. It's a sad day for the music world, but Joe had an amazing run in the industry and will be loved and missed.

RIP Joe Cocker, 1944-2014.
