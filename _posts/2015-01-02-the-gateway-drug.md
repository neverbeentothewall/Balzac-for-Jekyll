I spend most of my nights wrapped in awful, careless insomnia.  I can’t eat.  I can’t think about anything.  I can’t create, or write, or listen to music.  I just stare around my room and my apartment and wait until the reverberating bass that seeps through the paper thin walls of my apartment complex slowly fades and I finally shut my eyes, just in time for my morning alarm. 
 
Sometimes I drink.  Sometimes I call you.  It doesn’t matter what I do, it’s usually never enough to make me truly tired.
When you’re an insomniac, you begin to crave dreaming.  Without it we learn to pretend in our waking life.  We learn to displace where we are and what we are doing in order to get our dream fixes in.  Dreams are the insomniac’s crack or cocaine.  Lucid dreams are heroin.  

So I forget, a lot of the times, what is and what isn’t real.  These passing slides of marathons, the tour de France, orange jumpsuits, rocket ships.  Outer space, a lover’s touch, the open road, also dwell on and into fatigue, a place in which I’ve come to establish permanent residence. I walk through my waking life with my eyes barely open – the light’s on, but nobody’s home.  The elevator’s running, but it isn’t going up.  The telephone’s connected, but there’s no dial tone.  It all bears repeating, or else I won’t remember.

A good way to remember to make your bed every morning is to never sleep in it at night.
Until you realize that much of your life has been lived unaccounted for, and that you’ve been living life in negative time, displacement is a perfectly fine way to function.  The missing time starts out in increments as small as the time it takes you to leave your apartment and walk to your car but eventually turns into days in airports or weeks in hospital beds.  
And eventually you lose it all.
